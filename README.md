# CookWhat - A Swift Recipe Finder

CookWhat is a SwiftUI application that helps you find recipes based on the ingredients you have. Simply enter your ingredients, and CookWhat will fetch a list of recipes that use those ingredients. 

Note: It's a work in progress

## Features

- Add and remove ingredients
- Fetch recipes based on the ingredients you have
- View detailed information about each recipe

## Technical Highlights

- Written in Swift and SwiftUI
- Uses the MVVM architectural pattern
- Unit tests for ViewModel logic
- Asynchronous API calls to fetch recipes
- Dynamic UI updates using SwiftUI's `@Published` and `@ObservedObject`

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CookWhat.git`
2. Open the project in Xcode: `open CookWhat.xcworkspace`
3. Choose a simulator and click the Run button

## Testing
